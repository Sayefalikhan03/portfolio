# Sayef Ali Khan — Portfolio
> **Senior Frontend Architect & AI Systems Engineer**

A bespoke, high-performance portfolio showcasing the intersection of **AI Reliability** and **Systems Engineering**. Built with a commitment to **Intentional Minimalism**.

## 🏛️ Architectural Philosophy: Intentional Minimalism
*   **Anti-Generic**: Every element is calculated for purpose. If it doesn't serve the narrative of technical excellence, it is deleted.
*   **Performance-First**: Zero-dependency frontend architecture. Pure HTML5 and Modern CSS variables for sub-millisecond rendering.
*   **Responsive Integrity**: Hand-crafted media queries ensuring WCAG AAA legibility across all viewport dimensions.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
*   **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, Modern CSS (Variable-driven), Inter & Outfit typography.
*   **Systems**: Linux-based hosting, custom backup protocols (Cloud NAS).
*   **AI Integration**: Gemini API for news automation, PyTorch for T2I research.
